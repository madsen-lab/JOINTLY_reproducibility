# JOINTLY

JOINTLY is an algorithm for interpretable joint clustering of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq, using kernel-based joint non-negative matrix factorization. JOINTLY effectively captures shared cell states, while robustly accounting for dataset-specific states. JOINTLY is available as an R package [here](https://github.com/madsen-lab/rJOINTLY) and as a Python package [here](https://github.com/madsen-lab/pyJOINTLY). 

This repository holds scripts to reproduce the analyses presented in the manuscript. 

Datasets, intermediary files and results are availiable for download [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8298157)

For the white adipose tissue atlas (WATLAS), the model weights are availiable [here](https://zenodo.org/deposit/8086433) and the atlas can be explored and downloaded [here](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP2289/an-integrated-single-cell-and-single-nucleus-rna-seq-white-adipose-tissue-atlas-watlas)
